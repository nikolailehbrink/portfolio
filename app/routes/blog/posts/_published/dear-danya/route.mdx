You were the reason I started playing chess almost five years ago.

I've grown so fond of you because of the way you were.

How you could imitate any chess player, how articulate and intelligent you were, how you remained professional even in the face of the most serious accusations.

And then there was your unmatched ability to teach chess.

How you always eagerly pulled out books from the 1800s from your glass cabinet or recall a specific move from a game played like 58 years ago.

If there's one thing I know in this world, it's that you loved this game with all your heart.

And now I don't know what to do with the sadness and the anger about the circumstances, so I am writing here.

It hurts to know that you’ll never upload another speedrun video, never light up with excitement when Magnus accepts your challenge, and never again see just how much you’ve impacted this game.

Thank you for the unforgettable, educational and funny times.

Nikolai
