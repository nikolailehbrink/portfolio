If you’re building a website or web application, you’ll want to make sure your site is discoverable by search engines. One essential step is providing a [sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview) that lists all your public routes.

<Alert type="question" heading="Why automate your sitemap?">
  Manually maintaining a sitemap is tedious and error-prone. By generating it
  from your route definitions, you ensure it’s always up-to-date and accurate.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- A project using **React Router 7** or **Remix**.
- Access to your route definitions via `virtual:react-router/server-build` or `virtual:remix/server-build`.

## Install the `@forge42/seo-tools` package

First, install the <ProfileBadge platform="GitHub" handle="forge-42/seo-tools">@forge42/seo-tools</ProfileBadge> package. This library provides utilities for handling SEO-related tasks and has a dedicated `@forge42/seo-tools/remix` export that works with Remix and React Router 7 applications.

```bash
npm install @forge42/seo-tools
```

## Create the resource route for the sitemap

Create a file at `app/routes/sitemap.xml.ts`. This will be the [resource route](https://reactrouter.com/how-to/resource-routes) and exports a `loader` that generates the sitemap on demand:

```typescript filename="app/routes/sitemap.xml.ts" showLineNumbers
import { generateRemixSitemap } from "@forge42/seo-tools/remix/sitemap";
import type { Route } from "./+types/sitemap.xml";
import { href } from "react-router";

export const loader = async ({ request }: Route.LoaderArgs) => {
  const { routes } = await import("virtual:react-router/server-build");
  const { origin } = new URL(request.url);
  const sitemap = await generateRemixSitemap({
    domain: origin,
    ignore: [href("/api/chat"), href("/legal-notice"), href("/privacy-policy")],
    // @ts-expect-error Type mismatch, maybe related to a stricter type mentioned in release notes for v.7.0.0
    // https://github.com/forge-42/seo-tools/issues/8
    routes,
  });

  return new Response(sitemap, {
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/xml",
    },
  });
};
```

### What’s happening here?

<NewsletterForm />

1.  Dynamically import `virtual:react-router/server-build` to get your route definitions.
    <Alert type="info">
      Since [React Router
      v7.4.0](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v740),
      the `virtual:react-router/server-build` module is type safe and you can
      destructure your `routes` object from it.
    </Alert>
2.  The `generateRemixSitemap()` helper function takes your route definitions and creates a valid sitemap.
    <Alert type="info">
      Because the package is build for Remix v2, the function automatically
      looks for routes in `virtual:remix/server-build`, but with React Router 7,
      the correct module would be `virtual:react-router/server-build`. That’s
      why we have to import the `routes` in the previous step by hand. I already
      [opened an issue](https://github.com/forge-42/seo-tools/issues/13) to get
      native support for React Router 7.
    </Alert>
3.  The `ignore` option excludes routes you don’t want indexed (like API endpoints or legal pages).
    <Alert type="question" heading="Why ignore some routes?">
      Not every route should be indexed by search engines. Exclude API
      endpoints, admin pages, or anything private.
    </Alert>
    I prefer using the `href()` function from React Router 7 for type-safe
    paths.
    <Alert type="tip">
      The `href` function was introduced in [React Router
      v7.2.0](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v720)
      and ensures type safety for your links.
    </Alert>
4.  The `domain` option specifies the domain for your URLs. Using the request’s `origin` should work in any environment.
5.  The response returns the sitemap as XML with the correct content type.

For more information and advanced usage, check out the [official documentation](https://github.com/forge-42/seo-tools).

## Register the route

Make sure the route is included in your route config:

```typescript filename="app/routes.ts"
export default [
  // ...
  route("sitemap.xml", "routes/sitemap.xml.ts"),
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

Now, visiting `/sitemap.xml` in your browser will return a fresh, up-to-date sitemap!

<Alert type="warning" heading="Duplicate route registration">
  When using the package, I found the home route (`/`) was registered multiple
  times in the sitemap. See [issue
  #12](https://github.com/forge-42/seo-tools/issues/12).
</Alert>

## Test your sitemap

Visit `/sitemap.xml` in your browser or use an [online validator](https://www.mysitemapgenerator.com/service/check.html) to check that your sitemap is valid and includes all the right routes.

## Submit the sitemap to search engines

To have your sitemap indexed, you should submit it to search engines. Most will discover it if you [link to it from your `robots.txt`](/blog/robots-txt-react-router-7#automatic-sitemap-integration), but submitting directly is more reliable.

- For Google, use [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps).
- For Bing, use [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/sitemaps).
