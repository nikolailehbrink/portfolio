import NewsletterForm from "@/components/react/NewsletterForm";

When working on a Next.js project with **deeply nested routes**, I wanted a simple way to navigate “up” the hierarchy without composing the entire path every time.

Normally this wouldn't be much of a problem, but in my case, I had dynamic segments in the URL (like `/tasks/[id]/details/...`), which meant that I had to

- `await{:js}` the `id` param to every page that needed to display links
- pass down the `id` to every server component that needed to build links

Also not a huge deal, but it felt unnecessary, so I searched for alternatives.

## Relative Paths with `<Link>`

At first, I thought this wasn’t possible since the Next.js docs don’t explicitly cover it. But then I tried:

```tsx
<Link href="..">Back</Link>
```

And it worked. It navigated me up two levels, but why?

### Standard HTML Behaviour

Then I realized why there was no documentation for this behaviour: It's actually just [how anchor tags work in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/PR-html40-971107/struct/links.html#h-12.4) and since the `<Link>{:tsx}` is a wrapper around an `<a>{:html}` tag, the underlying behavior is the same.

### Relative Links in Action

To demonstrate this, imagine you’re on this URL:

```bash
https://yourdomain.com/customer/1/details/address
```

Here’s how different relative links behave:

```tsx // filename="app/customer/[id]/details/address/page.tsx"
import Link from "next/link";

export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Same folder, sibling site → /customer/1/details/billing */}
      <Link href="billing">Billing</Link>

      {/* Same folder, parent site → /customer/1/details */}
      <Link href=".">Customer Details</Link>

      {/* One level up → /customer/1 */}
      <Link href="..">Customer</Link>

      {/* Two levels up → /customer */}
      <Link href="../..">Customer list</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<NewsletterForm />

## Comparison in practice

Here’s a quick comparison from my project.

**Before (absolute paths):**

```tsx
export default async function AddressPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>;
}) {
  const { id } = await params;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product Address</h1>
      {/* ... */}
      <Link href={`/customer/${id}/details`}>Back to Details</Link>
      <Link href={`/customer/${id}`}>Back to Product</Link>
      <Link href="/customer">All customers</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**After (relative paths):**

```tsx
export default function AddressPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product Address</h1>
      {/* ... */}
      <Link href=".">Back to Details</Link>
      <Link href="..">Back to Product</Link>
      <Link href="/customer">All customers</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

What I like is that the links still work, even when the dynamic segment name changes.
